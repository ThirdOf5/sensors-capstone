CSCI 250 Capstone Project

Author: Caleb Jhones
Date: Fall 2017
Professor: Dr. Wendy Fisher

Purpose:
    I will be using the R Pi to monitor moisture readings in a potted plant's soil, and then watering the plant when it
    is thirsty. I will be using a soilenoid to control water flow to the pot.
